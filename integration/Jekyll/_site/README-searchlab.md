This is an example on how to integrate the searchlab into a Jekyll content.
To use Jekyll, do
 gem install bundler jekyll

This jekyll page was made with the command
 jekyll new Jekyll
 cd Jekyll

.. and then edited to provide the searchlab client inside the _include folder

To serve the content of this page and the searchlab client, run:
  bundle exec jekyll serve

.. and open http://127.0.0.1:4000/
Click on "Searchlab Search" in the upper right corner.
