# We are creating a search lab!

This is a placeholder for the upcoming YaCy search service that is hosted here. We will provide on-demand search indexes and data science apps to evaluate crawled data. You will be able to upload a YaCy index. You will be able to start web crawls here and download the result as index file which can be inserted into your own YaCy instance.

Furthermore, you will be able to run this portal yourself in your home or your intranet.
