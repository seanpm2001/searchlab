#### This is a placeholder for the upcoming YaCy search service that is hosted here. We will provide on-demand search indexes and data science apps to evaluate crawled data. You will be able to upload a YaCy index. You will be able to start web crawls here and download the result as index file which can be inserted into your own YaCy instance.

### You will be able to run this portal yourself in your home, your intranet or as your own searchlab portal.
